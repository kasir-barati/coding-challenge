## Why MUI?

Because of development speed, ease of use, popularity, and following a well-known standard.

# Why `useState` hook?

If it was a real ECommerce website I would use RTK -- Redux toolkit. For the time being I just used react hooks since it was sufficient. I know we can say almost the same thing about MUI but IMO MUI is more like tailwind or bootstrap. I think we can save time by using MUI and focusing on developing the product. Then if we faced performance issues we can do something about it.

Notice: I think it may seems a bit odd to compare a UI design tool and Redux which is a state management tool :sweat_smile:, but anyhow I did :joy:.

# Why no Unit test?

Had not enough time to write test, at least not at the defined time box. So basically I just did it after ward. you can ignore them.
